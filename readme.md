# TinyGolf for Thumby

![Screenshot of TinyGolf title screen](./tiny_golf.png)

Play nine holes of mini golf action, made tiny!

Features:
* A variety of terrain and hazards
* Detailed vector graphics and physics
* Continuous play (with autosave) and practice mode
* Grayscale and black-and-white graphics options

NOTE: framerate is choppy in the emulator, but is much better on the Thumby

This is the same code as the version in the Thumby arcade, but with all the
original comments, plus the utilities I used to bake the level data.
